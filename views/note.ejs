            <h2><a href="/book/NegotiateAnything">You Can Negotiate Anything - by Herb Cohen</a></h2>

            <small>Date read: 2023-08-02. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>10</strong>/10</small>

            <p>Everything is negotiable. Challenge authority. You have the power in any situation. This is how to
                realize it and use it. A must-read classic from 1980 from a master negotiator. My notes here aren’t
                enough because the little book is filled with so many memorable stories — examples of great
                day-to-day moments of negotiation that will stick in your head for when you need them. (I especially
                loved the one about the power of the prisoner in solitary confinement.) So go buy and read the book.
                I’m giving it a 10/10 rating even though the second half of the book loses steam, because the first
                half is so crucial.

            <p>Power is the capacity or ability to get things done.
                It determines whether you can or can’t influence your environment.
                It gives you a sense of mastery over your life.
